# AIRBNB-PROJECT-ANALYSIS-BY-PYTHON
***This project involves comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Airbnb listings data to uncover key insights into pricing trends, location-based availability, host behavior, and guest preferences. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, the project transforms raw data into meaningful patterns through data cleaning, feature engineering, and interactive visualizations.***
